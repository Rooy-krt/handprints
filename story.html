                    <p>
                        <strong>Handprints Society</strong> was founded on a journey of compassion, faith, and lived experience.
                        John and I, <strong>Jacinta</strong>, carried a calling that grew quietly in our hearts long before the ministry officially began.
                        John’s childhood was marked by real struggle. He grew up in a very humble home where securing even one meal was uncertain.
                        Going to school was often impossible, not because he lacked the desire, but because the means were simply not there.
                        The house he lived in was shattered, offering little comfort or protection. These hardships shaped him and formed a deep understanding
                        of what it means to live without the basic things many take for granted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When God later blessed us and lifted us into a better life, John never forgot where he came from.
                        Instead of erasing those painful memories, he allowed them to guide his heart.
                        He carried a quiet but firm conviction that no child should go hungry, no widow should suffer alone,
                        and no family should be left without hope simply because help was out of reach.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In <strong>2010</strong>, John and I received a strong calling from God to step out and serve the needy.
                        Together, we began reaching out to vulnerable families and communities one step at a time.
                        I faithfully stood, supporting the vision, praying, planning, and carrying the same compassion John carried.
                        Our home, our hearts, and even our limited resources became tools for ministry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the years, the work grew from sharing meals with widows during Christmas, to sponsoring children,
                        to organizing medical camps, and supporting families in crisis.
                        What began as a simple act of obedience started to transform entire communities.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A Turning Point — The Birth of Bushfire Ministries</h2>

                    <p>
                        A significant moment came in <strong>2022</strong> during an outreach trip to Karia village in West Pokot.
                        A need was discovered by John. While exploring the area, he encountered a remote and neglected region,
                        far from the nearest market center. The people there were living in dire conditions — many lacked access
                        to basic necessities, and <strong>100% of the villagers he met were illiterate</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The burden of this discovery stirred him to take action — to bring transformation through evangelism,
                        education, and humanitarian aid. The community’s overwhelming need, combined with the burning desire
                        to bring lasting transformation, led to the birth of <strong>Bushfire Ministries</strong>,
                        a branch of Handprints Society.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The name <em>“Bushfire”</em> symbolized a flame of hope spreading rapidly across dry and forgotten places,
                        bringing light, warmth, and restoration. It became the identity under which the Pokot church, preschool,
                        and outreach center grew.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Today and Beyond</h2>

                    <p>
                        Today, Handprints Society continues to build upon this foundation that was laid.
                        The ministry has expanded its reach across regions in Kenya, touching hundreds of lives through education,
                        food relief, healthcare, shelter, and spiritual support.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even though John is no longer with us, his heart lives on in every project, every child helped,
                        every widow supported, and every village reached.
                        God’s work has continued to flourish, strengthened by the prayers, generosity, and support of people
                        from all over the world who stand with this ministry.
                    </p>
