                        <h2>1) Bushfire Ministry</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Bushfire Ministry serves as the umbrella body for Handprints Society’s outreach in Pokot. 
                        Founded with a vision to transform remote and marginalized communities, it embodies love, 
                        hope, compassion, and transformation tailored to the needs of West Pokot. Through this arm, 
                        we coordinate projects addressing education, spiritual growth, healthcare, and community 
                        development — facilitating sustainable change and expanding our reach.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Under Bushfire Ministry, we operate two primary initiatives:</h4>

                    <h3>i) Bushfire New Vision School – Pokot</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Karia village, West Pokot, where children once had no access to education, God enabled us 
                        to establish Bushfire New Vision Academy. What began with a few children learning under a tree 
                        has grown into a school serving 65 children — providing quality education, a feeding program, 
                        supplies, and spiritual nurture. Daily porridge and meals encourage attendance and protect 
                        children from early marriage, illiteracy, and hopelessness. We are committed to building 
                        classrooms, hiring teachers, and empowering children to break the cycle of poverty.
                    </p>

                    <h3>ii) West Pokot Outreach Center</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Karia village, West Pokot, we responded to God’s call to love those deemed unreachable. 
                        In a land where early marriages and lack of healthcare are prevalent, we planted seeds of 
                        transformation. We dream of building a full school and dispensary to serve this community 
                        holistically.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-heading"><h2>2) Widows Christmas Food Basket</h2></div>
                    <p>
                        What began as a small outreach to ensure widows and orphans do not go hungry during Christmas 
                        has grown, by God’s grace, from serving 20 widows to over 1,000 every year. Each widow receives 
                        a basket filled with rice, flour, beans, maize, sugar, tea leaves, soap, salt, matchsticks, 
                        and cooking oil — a celebration of Christ’s love for the women closest to His heart.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-heading"><h2>3) Free Medical Camps & Jigger Campaigns</h2></div>
                    <p>
                        Through our medical missions, we bring Christ’s healing touch to communities with little or no 
                        healthcare access. We offer free check-ups, treatments, basic cancer screenings, eye care, and 
                        health education. In Western Kenya, our jigger campaigns have restored dignity and greatly reduced 
                        infestations, giving communities renewed hope.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-heading"><h2>4) Education Project</h2></div>
                    <p>
                        Education unlocks destiny. We support children from disadvantaged backgrounds with school fees, 
                        uniforms, supplies, and mentorship — from primary to university level. Our mission is to bridge 
                        the gap between a child’s current challenges and the bright future God has prepared for them.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-heading"><h2>5) House Building Ministry</h2></div>
                    <p>
                        Many widows and vulnerable families live in unsafe shelters. God placed a burden on our hearts to 
                        restore dignity by building secure, permanent homes. Every completed home stands as a testimony of 
                        His love and faithfulness.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-heading"><h2>6) Famine Relief Program</h2></div>
                    <p>
                        During seasons of drought or financial hardship, we provide food supplies to families facing hunger. 
                        This ministry offers nourishment and encouragement, reminding families that God sees and cares for them.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-heading"><h2>7) King’s Kids Program</h2></div>
                    <p>
                        This program nurtures the spiritual growth of children through Bible studies, fun activities, 
                        mentorship, and discipleship. We teach children that they are loved by God, created with purpose, 
                        and capable of becoming strong, godly leaders.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-heading"><h2>8) Dorcas Empowerment Project</h2></div>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by the biblical Dorcas, this project empowers widows through skills training and business 
                        support. We provide seed capital, mentorship, and training in activities like tailoring, beadwork, 
                        farming, and retail — helping widows achieve economic independence and restored hope.
